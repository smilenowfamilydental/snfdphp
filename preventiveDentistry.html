          <p>Professional cleanings performed by a hygienist or dental assistant are important to your dental health as are daily brushing and flossing. Using specialized tools we will:</p>
          <ul class="text-left">
            <li>
              • Remove plaque build-up from the surfaces of teeth. Bacteria in the mouth form plaque, which collects on teeth and causes decay, gum disease and gingivitis.
            </li>
            <li>
              • Remove tartar from teeth surfaces. Tartar, or calculus, is plaque that has become so hardened on the teeth that its removal requires special procedures. Tartar below the gum line is also an indicator of gum disease, and generally appears on older children
              and adults
            </li>
            <li>• Help with brushing and flossing techniques, and encouraging healthy eating habits at home to promote good oral development </li>
            <li>

          <h3>Dental Health and Fluoride Treatment</h3>
          <p>Fluoride is a mineral that occurs naturally in many foods and water. Every day, minerals are added to and lost from a tooth's enamel layer through two processes, demineralization and remineralization. Minerals are lost (demineralization) from
            a tooth's enamel layer when acids -- formed from plaque bacteria and sugars in the mouth -- attack the enamel. Minerals such as fluoride, calcium, and phosphate are redeposited (remineralization) to the enamel layer from the foods and waters
            consumed. Too much demineralization without enough remineralization to repair the enamel layer leads to tooth decay.</p>
          <p>Fluoride is applied as a gel, foam or varnish during a dental appointment. The teeth are dried so the fluoride doesn't become diluted. Fluoride gel or foam can be applied by using a tray that looks like a mouth guard for one to four minutes.
            Fluoride varnish can be painted directly on parts of the teeth that are most likely to get a cavity, to strengthen them. This is an advantage of varnish over gel or foam. Varnish also contains a very strong concentration of fluoride. Topical
            fluoride comes in a variety of flavors, but it should never be swallowed.</p>

          <h3>Mouth Guard For Teeth Grinding</h3>
          <p>Bruxism, the medical term for grinding your teeth, affects about 8 percent of adults, according to the National Sleep Foundation. From the occasional sore jaw to chronic grinding, it can be a serious problem. Whether the grinding is new or a
            lifelong habit, it's often difficult to tell whether it's a mere annoyance or a serious problem. If you experience one of the following, it may be time to visit your dentist to talk about a mouth guard for teeth grinding.</p>
          <ul class="text-left">
            <li>

          <h3>Dental Sealants</h3>
          <p>Dental sealants are plastic coatings that are usually placed on the chewing (occlusal) surface of the permanent back teeth — the molars and premolars — to help protect them from decay.</p>
          <p>Sealants are accepted as an effective preventive method for cavities and as long as the sealant remains adhered to the tooth, cavities can be prevented. It is for this reason that sealant success is now measured by the length of time a sealant
            remains on the tooth, rather than the decay experienced in sealed and unsealed teeth. The ability of a pit and fissure sealant to prevent dental caries is highly dependent on its ability to retain on the tooth surface.</p>

          <h3>Children's Dentistry</h3>
          <p>Our doctors know how to work with patients of all ages, and understand ways to help children feel comfortable during their visits. We encourage exams and cleanings to be a regular part of oral health, starting at a very young age. Even baby
            teeth need to be maintained to ensure that they grow properly until they are replaced with adult teeth. Cavities and gum disease can occur in baby teeth as well as adult teeth, with children being less equipped to deal with the discomfort
            that can occur. Just like adults, we recommend that parents bring their children to cleanings with us at least twice a year.</p>

          <h3>Oral Cancer Screenings</h3>
          <p>During every routine checkup in our office, we provide an oral cancer screening to protect patients’ oral and overall health. As many as 30% of patients diagnosed with oral cancer annually do not engage in any high risk behaviors associated
            with oral cancer, such as using tobacco products. Regular screenings in our office ensure patients receive diagnosis in the earliest stages when they have the optimal chance for a full recovery.
